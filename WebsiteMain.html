                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p id = firstLetter>
                    The little brown myotis is a type of mouse-eared microbat found in North America. 
                    It has a little body size and shiny dark colored hide. It is comparative in appearance to a few other mouse-eared bats, 
                    counting the Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and Arizona myotis, to which it is firmly related. In spite of its name, 
                    the little brown myotis isn't firmly identified with the large brown bat, which has a place with an alternate class.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    Its mating framework is polygynandrous, or indiscriminate, and females bring forth one posterity yearly. 
                    The posterity, called pups, 
                    are immediately weaned and arrive at adult size in certain measurements by three weeks old. 
                    The little brown myotis has a mean life expectancy of 6.5 years, 
                    however one individual in the wild arrived at 34 years of age. It is nocturnal, 
                    searching for its creepy crawly prey around evening time and perching in empty trees or structures during the day, 
                    among less normal perch types.
                    It explores and finds prey with echolocation.
                </p>
                <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
                <p>
                    The Little Brown Myotis has excellent vision, although they also use echolocation to navigate and to detect food sources such as insects. 
                    In one hour they are capable of catching up to 1000 insects. They are predated by raccoons, hawks, owls, and snakes.

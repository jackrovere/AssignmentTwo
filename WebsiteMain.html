                        <h2>General Information 1</h2>
                        <p> The little brown myotis is a type of mouse-eared
                             microbat found in North America. It has a little
                              body size and shiny dark colored hide. It is 
                              comparative in appearance to a few other 
                              mouse-eared bats, counting the Indiana bat, 
                              northern long-eared bat, and Arizona myotis, 
                              to which it is firmly related. In spite of its 
                              name, the little brown myotis isn't firmly 
                              identified with the large brown bat, which 
                              has a place with an alternate class.
                        </p>

                        <h2>General Information 2</h2>
                        <p> Its mating framework is polygynandrous, 
                            or indiscriminate, and females bring forth 
                            one posterity yearly. The posterity, called 
                            pups, are immediately weaned and arrive at 
                            adult size in certain measurements by three 
                            weeks old. The little brown myotis has a mean 
                            life expectancy of 6.5 years, however one 
                            individual in the wild arrived at 34 years of 
                            age. It is nocturnal, searching for its creepy 
                            crawly prey around evening time and perching in 
                            empty trees or structures during the day, among 
                            less normal perch types. It explores and finds 
                            prey with echolocation.

                        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
                        <p> The Little Brown Myotis has excellent vision, 
                            although they also use echolocation to navigate 
                            and to detect food sources such as insects. 
                            In one hour they are capable of catching up to 
                            1000 insects. They are predated by raccoons, hawks, 
                            owls, and snakes.
